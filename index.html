      <h3>Who Am I And How Did I Get Here?</h3>
        <p class="lead">My name is Matt, but most people call me Nardo (short for my surname Nardoni). I came to Epicodus with experience gained from the University of Oregon but without the means to profit financially or emotionally. I have always been active with technology, yet I lacked any sort of in depth knowledge on the subject of computer technology or programming. Now I find myself combining my social, educational, and newly developed technical skills in an effort to impress myself on today's code review.</p>
